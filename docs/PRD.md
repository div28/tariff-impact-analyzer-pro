# Tariff Calculator - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
A user-friendly, mobile-first web calculator that allows US importers and analysts to instantly estimate the financial impact of 2025 tariffs with actionable supplier comparisons and risk mitigation guidance.

## Problem Statement

Small-to-medium US importers and business analysts lack a current, scenario-focused tool to estimate the cost impact of proposed 2025 tariffs. As tariff policy evolves rapidly, business owners face critical uncertainty, exposing them to the risk of costly supplier misjudgments and inadequate mitigation planning. 

No available calculators integrate real-time or announced tariff policies, leaving these segments to guess, delay decisions, or overpay. Students and researchers similarly lack an accessible reference point to quantify and analyze policy impacts, inhibiting informed debate and learning.

## High Level Approach

Develop a user-friendly, mobile-first web calculator that allows importers and analysts to instantly estimate the financial impact of 2025 tariffs. The calculator will leverage current and mock tariff data, support live deployment, and deliver actionable supplier comparisons and risk mitigation guidance. Results will be trustworthy, sourced, shareable, and optimized for efficient, real-world decision-making.

## User Narrative

A midsize retailer's imports are due to arrive next month, but a breaking announcement confirms new 2025 tariffs will take effect August 1st. The owner, pressed for answers and with thousands at stake, uses the Tariff Calculator to compare costs from China and Germany, quickly realizing their German supplier is now dramatically more expensive. 

A procurement manager, needing to plan orders for Q4, toggles between pre- and post-August scenarios to assess budget impact and deadlines. Meanwhile, a trade consultant demonstrates the calculator in a client meeting, using live scenarios to explain risk and drive actionable recommendations. At a local university, a student tests supply chain "what-if" scenarios for a presentation, building credible models on real policy data. 

In all cases, the calculator saves hours, prevents costly errors, and gives users a timely edge.

## Impact Sizing Model

### User Reach
- **Bootcamp**: 50–100 assignment reviewers
- **Portfolio Traffic** (6 months): 500–1,000 visitors
- **Organic SEO** (year 1): 1,000–2,000 potential SMB/research users

### Scenario Calculations
Assuming 30% calculate more than one scenario:
Yearly scenarios = (2,000 × 1.3) ≈ 2,600

### Per User Impact
If 10% avoid/mitigate $500 in costs = $130,000 aggregate
